# Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

# Writing Tests

Tests are located in test-folder. All tests have component names with .test.js extension.

Basic structure of unit test file: 

```bash
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import Component from './Component'; // replace with path to component

describe('Component', () => {
  test('renders Component component without crashing', () => {
    render(<Component />);
    // Add your assertions here
  });

  // Add more tests as needed
});
```
